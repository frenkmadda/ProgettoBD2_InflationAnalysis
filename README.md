# Progetto Data Base 2
## Inflation Analysis Platform
The idea of the project is to analyze several datasets found on the Kaggle platform related to inflation. \
In particular, we want to focus first on inflation at the global level and then
study the phenomenon country by country with a focus on the food market. \

### Steps and functionalities
The first step will be to analyze the structure of the datasets, import them into MongoDB and,
simultaneously, begin a small preliminary exploratory analysis. \
Then basic CRUD operations will be implemented to explore possible studies
follow-up. For example, one idea is to compare how much inflation has affected the
food market in the countries by combining the available information. \
Subsequently, the results of the above analysis will be represented through
graphical visualizations for better understanding.
